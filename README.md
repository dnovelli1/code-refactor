# Code Refactor!

## In this project, I was given the code to the website "Horiseon". The issue was that the code was very clunky and needed to be cleaned up with semantic elements and some minor fixes. In this project you will see well organized and easy to read code. The refactor is extremely important because I want anyone else working with the same code as myself to able to easily process my code and the structure.

## Technology I Put to Work!
- GitHub - repository storage for the project in order to make changes, deploy and push them to a main branch.

- GitBash - used for written commands and communicating with the repository stored on GitHub.

- HTML - used to create and edit electronic documents stored on the web.

- CSS - used to edit style and appearance of the website.
