# Code Refactor!

## In this project, I was given the code to the website "Horiseon". The issue was that the code was very clunky and needed to be cleaned up with semantic elements and some minor fixes. In this project you will see well organized and easy to read code. The refactor is extremely important because I want anyone else working with the same code as myself to able to easily process my code and the structure.
