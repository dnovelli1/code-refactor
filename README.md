# code-refactor
In this activity I was given the code of a website that needed to be cleaned up and made more legible for people to read easier. I started by spacing out the code and addding semantics to replace some of the non semantic code. After replacing these, I scrolled through the code noticiing smaller malfunctions with links and no alt's for the images. After adding that, I made some minor adjustments to the style.css in order for the style to take effect on the website.
